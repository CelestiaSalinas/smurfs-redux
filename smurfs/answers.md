1. Eliminates the need for prop-drilling.
2. Store holds global state, actions are events/user interactions, reducers update global state based on actions.
3. application state is global, component is local.
4. it's a middleware that allows asynchronous actions.
5. I dont really have a favorite, but I might prefer context.
